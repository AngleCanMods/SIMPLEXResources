Who would like to use this mod? Anyone who wants to flavour their stockish game a little, without jumping down a realism rabbit hole.

## Introducing an extended resource system for Kerbal Space Program.

Rather than having a single non descriptive Ore for mining and converting to anything and possibly everything, this mod removes the stock Ore and replaces it.

**![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/3498db/000000?text=+) HydrateOre** ices, and is used for making LiquidFuel or as a part of Life Support mods.

**![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/2980b9/000000?text=+) Saturate** effectively liquid HydrateOre.  Where this is availble, either on the surface or under pressure, it requires less energy than HydrateOre to mine and process, but is not widely available.

**![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e67e22/000000?text=+) NaturalOre** is used to generate MetalParts to build rockets (using Extraplanetary Launchpads).

**![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f1c40f/000000?text=+) RareOre** is used to generate CustomParts used to build rockets (using Extraplanetary Launchpads), and also in Life Support mods.

**![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/9b59b6/000000?text=+) XenonGas** is able to be to extracted from the atmosphere of certain planets.

**ArgonGas** is now available without CRP for mods

**StoredCharge** is now available without CRP for mods specifically NearFuture Electrical.
**NuclearFuel** and **NuclearWaste** are the fuels for reactors in NearFuture Electrical.

**CyroFuel** is now available for CryoEngines and CryoTanks and replaces LqdMethane
LH2 was been replaced CryoTanks, CryoEngines, and Kerbal Atomics for LFO engines, with names patched too.

Asteroids contain **NaturalOre**, with a possibility of **HydrateOre** and/or **RareOre**.

Comets contain **HydrateOre** only.

In addition, this mod configures the extraordinary [Extraplanetary Launchpads](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/54284-151-extraplanetary-launchpads-v633/) originally by skykooler, and maintained by taniwha.

Two resources are introduced for this purpose, extending the vanilla approach of EL.

**![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/7f8c8d/000000?text=+) MetalParts** and **![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1abc9c/000000?text=+) CustomParts** are used in a unique recipes, making off world construction a little more complicated with two resources needed.
